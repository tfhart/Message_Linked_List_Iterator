# Message_Linked_List_Iterator

This program was written by Thomas Hart in the Spring of 2014 for CS 367 (Data Structures).

The main class is DisplayEditor.java and it calls upon other classes. Reads in files and messages, and promts the user with options on what they would like to do next. Choices they have include displaying the dot matrixes, going to the next one, going to the previous ones, etc.
